> App to log your physical state in a simple yet complete manner.

This is an abandoned project. Read further to discover the original idea, why I abandoned it, and what I learned from it.

## Screenshots

Here's a glance of what has been made so far.

## What I've learned

* MVC architecture.
* Supabase (database, storage, and Flutter implementation).
* Some cool Flutter packages:
    * [get](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for state management.
    * [brick](https://getdutchie.github.io/brick/#/) for an offline-first database.
    * [fl_chart](https://flchart.dev) for fancy charts.
    * [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) to input user images.
* I realized that Flutter isn't always (**usually it's not**) the best tool. [This video](https://youtu.be/OCwcedYTKDc?t=274&si=Z_dBPWzDcWZ37DZY) explains why very well.
* Spreadsheets are really powerful, I should use them more often.

## Why it's abandoned

When I started I decided to develop this project to solve the problem for myself, learn in the process, and solve it for more people if they also had it.

I now look at it with different eyes and think it’s a problem I initially perceived but later realized is actually solved by spreadsheets — and solved well, better than I thought.

And about the learning on the process, above it's what I've learned, and the rest would probably be diving further into Flutter, and I prefer focusing on other stuff.

## Original idea

Below is what I wrote when I started the project.

### Problem

Tracking progress is important because it helps people achieve their goals, in this case, their fitness goals.

However, tracking physical progress is a mess (weight here, photos there, etc.), and it’s hard to view and share the progress with a thorough yet easy-to-do analysis. You could have a well-configured spreadsheet exactly as you want, but it is cumbersome for fitness tracking due to its lack of automation, poor mobile experience, limited visualization, and absence of features like reminders and easy photo tracking.

To summarize, existing solutions offer a poor experience or are too time-consuming for people who simply care about how they've improved overall week after week rather than about every single detail.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FitnessArgentina/comments/1i6vo4e/ustedes_cómo_registran_su_progreso/)'s a survey I made in Reddit (it's in Spanish though).

### Solution

An app to log your physical state in a simple yet complete manner.

First, you set your goal. Whether you’re fat, skinny, or simply want to continue shaping your body, you would be covered.

Then, work out and periodically log your aesthetics, strength, and cardiovascular capacity, in very few input boxes. No complicated measurements would be needed.

I you had already been tracking your data in spreadsheets and your phone gallery, no problem, it wouldn't take you more than 5 minutes to import all of that into Ravifi.

Finally, you can analyze all your tracked data by making before and after comparisons, looking at charts, and getting AI insights, and seamlessly share your amazing progress with the ones you care about the most.

All your data would be available on all of your devices. But if you ever decide you don’t want to continue using the app, you could just export all your data.

#### Selling points

* Simplicity: Minimal input, maximum insight. No customizations required.
* Centralization: Combines tracking for aesthetics, strength, and cardio in one multi-platform app.
* AI-Powered: Insights to help you progress efficiently and keep your motivation.
* Data freedom: Import/export with ease.

#### Name

I first thought the basic name: was "Visual Physique Tracker". Then I copy-pasted it directly into Google Translate for Spanish and it said "Rastreador Visual de Físico". I took the first vowels of those three words and voilá: Ra-Vi-Fi -> Ravifi.

#### Logo

Rav-ifi -> Rav-en -> A raven 🐦‍⬛

### Bio

#### Growing up in Buenos Aires

I was born and raised in the neighborhood of [Caballito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caballito,_Buenos_Aires), Buenos Aires, Argentina, on August 2007, in a middle-class family with my brother, 3 years older than me, and two parents, both graduated system engineers from the [UTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Technological_University).

My life as a kid was fairly normal. Play, park, friends, sports, school. Football (⚽) has been my favorite sport, and [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) my favorite video game. I started playing soccer at a club when I was 7, and I continued there until the age allowed me, at 12. At around 10, I have a very clear memory, lying in my bed upside down, daydreaming about becoming a professional player when I grew up. Dices seemed to have been thrown, however, because I wasn't built for that; even though I had a healthy lifestyle, I was quite skinny and rather pale. I used to think that was just _normal for me_, until years later I realized it was not.

#### Discovering programming

2020 arrived with the [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) and my last year at primary school (7th grade). A few months locked in and many hours spent playing on my PS3 later, I started to question what I was spending my time on. At around the same time, my dad had suggested me to check about _this programming thing_, to see whether I was interested in it.

So I checked it out.

As far as I can remember, I started to learn programming in May 2020 mostly with YouTube videos—ChatGPT didn't exist yet—and by creating simple scripts with [Python](https://python.org). One day, wondering how to get out of the terminal environment and display actual graphics, I discovered [pygame](https://pygame.org); by November, I built my [first video game]({filename}/save-the-fish.md) ever.

I've really enjoyed building stuff, so I continued to develop [more projects](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). Until the age of 16, I just built personal projects, including, among others, [Jueguito Piola]({filename}/jueguito-piola.md), [Game Finder]({filename}/game-finder.md), and [Biome Fighters]({filename}/biome-fighters.md). In 2024, I got the opportunity to develop my [first paid project]({filename}/siderplast.md) thanks to a friend of mine.

That's how I learned to program, basically—I'd decide to build _X_, which required me to learn _Y_ in the process, and besides that I'd try to make each project different than the previous one in terms of learning, so each of them could teach me something new. Besides, as I grew up during my teens, my interest shifted increasingly more to programming.

#### Health issues

In the middle of 2022, I started playing soccer again in another club. Simultaneously, my physique got weaker, notoriously pale, and more underweight.

As an anecdote, in the club we once did an endurance test; I was the worst one, even among the category below mine. Another time, my dad and I went for a run to the park and, after literally 6 minutes of slow, non-stop jogging, I had to sit down on the floor because of absolute exhaustion. Given that I really wanted to get better at my sport, I used to push myself quite hard, thinking that I had to train way more and way harder.

One sunny day of 2024 summer holidays, with my family at [Miramar](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramar_(Buenos_Aires)), we went to the beach, as usual, in the morning. As any other day, we enjoyed the atmosphere, spent time relaxing, and I swam in the sea. In the afternoon, because it got cloudy, my mum suggested to go to the hospital for a checkup, given that I had gone badly to the bathroom the last days.

> This kid needs hospitalization and transfusion.

What? I had just swam in the sea that morning. But, indeed, in the following days we came back to our home city; I got hospitalized and, after a few days, I was—thankfully—diagnosed with celiac disease. Thankfully because, despite consuming everyday food like bread or pizza severely damages my intestine, after two months of strict diet, I gained ~10 kg, could jog for ~30 minutes, and my skin got normal—and not just for _normal for me_ this time. After six months I was able to jog for 80 minutes straight, and within a year people began noticing and even complimenting my physique. More importantly, I've noticeably felt better since then, with a lot more energy and simply better overall.

#### Taking the leap

Thanks to my dad's recommendation, since 2023 I'd listen to the [Tecnología Informal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrtLMjKidFAvi_CTWo5WQV3_X_E5FoaNg) podcast. I genuinely liked the way of thinking of the author, [Gabriel Benmergui](https://x.com/conanbatt). Two years later, he published the founding engineer [job position](https://x.com/Conanbatt/status/1886154690519249094) at his own company, [Silver.dev](https://silver.dev).

> This is my opportunity.

I thought, despite I didn't meet the requirements—not even the working hours, since I was still attending school in the mornings. But I applied, anyway.

A few days later, in February 2025, while hanging out with some friends, I received an email calling me to the live coding interview. If that alone was surprising, the email even detailed the problems I'd have to solve. Ignoring my confusion, I just practiced until I could solve them in time.

The interview day arrived and, indeed, I had to solve the problems I had practiced. Only one of the two, actually, so I solved the problem in half of the available time. To my great surprise, that was record time, so Gabriel was fascinated and hired me as an intern. I'd later discover that it was my answer to "Why are you interested in this position?" that attracted his attention in the first place, and that I had practiced way more usual for the interview.

In March, I participated in the my first hackathon ever, [ShipBA](https://shipba.dev), alongside the only programmer friend I knew and my cousin. Beyond the project itself, [Noticiar]({filename}/noticiar.md), I met a bunch of people involved in the tech world there. Although I didn't win the competition, they liked my presentation so much that they'd later invite me to more events, where I met even more people. In July, at my second hackathon, [Vibe a Startup](https://www.vibeastartup.com/), I placed third with my team by building and presenting [_el coso del cosito_]().

Among the people I've met this year, both [Santiago](https://x.com/santiagomelian_) and [Gadi](https://x.com/gadiborovich) separately suggested me to study at [Stanford](https://stanford.edu), something that hadn't even crossed my mind until then. After talking to [Lichu](https://x.com/lichuacu)—an Argentinean who got into Stanford—and thinking about it, I decided that I'd try to get in.

#### The End

And you've come to the end! If it feels that this story lacks an ending, that's because this is a live document, just as my life is. I'll come back here in a few months and update it as I go along. I hope you've enjoyed reading it!

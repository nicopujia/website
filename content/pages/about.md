### Growing up in Buenos Aires (2007–2019)

I was born and raised in the neighborhood of Caballito, Buenos Aires, **Argentina**, on August 2007, in a middle-class family with my brother, 3 years older than me, and two parents, both graduated system engineers from the [UTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Technological_University).

My life as a kid was fairly normal. **Football** has been my favorite sport, and **Minecraft** my favorite video game. I started playing football at a club when I was 7 and stayed there for 5 years. At around 10, I have a very clear memory, lying in my bed upside down, daydreaming about becoming a professional player when I grew up. However, I wasn't built for that: even though I had a healthy lifestyle, I was quite skinny and rather pale. I used to think that was just _normal for me_, until years later I realized it was not.

### Discovering programming (2020–2023)

2020 arrived with the [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) and my last year at primary school (7th grade). A few months locked in and many hours spent playing computer games, I started to question what I was spending my time on. At around the same time, my dad had suggested me to check about _this programming thing_, to see whether I was interested in it. So I checked it out.

I started to learn programming in May 2020 mostly with YouTube videos (ChatGPT didn't exist yet) and by creating simple scripts with **Python**. One day, wondering how to get out of the terminal environment and display actual graphics, I discovered **pygame**; by November, I built my [first video game]({filename}/save-the-fish.md) ever.

I've really enjoyed building stuff, so I continued to develop [more projects](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). Until the age of 16, I kept building personal projects, including, among others: a speedrun platformer game [Jueguito Piola]({filename}/jueguito-piola.md), made with **Godot Engine**, which triggered competition among my classmates; a game discovery app [Game Finder]({filename}/game-finder.md), made with **Dart** & **Flutter**, which reached 1k+ downloads on the Google Play Store and keeps getting new users every day; and an online, real-time, multiplayer game [Biome Fighters]({filename}/biome-fighters.md), made with Python & **FastAPI** and Godot Engine, which led me to participate in [BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters).

That's how I learned to program, basically; I used to decide to build _X_, which required me to learn _Y_ in the process, and I'd also try to make each project different than the previous one in terms of learning, so each of them could teach me something new. Besides, as I grew up during my teens, my interest shifted increasingly more to programming.

### Health issues (2018–2024)

In the middle of 2022, I started playing soccer again in another club. Simultaneously, my physique got weaker, notoriously pale, and more underweight.

As an anecdote, in the club we once did an endurance test; I was the worst one, even among the category below mine. Another time, my dad and I went for a run to the park and, after just 6 minutes of slow, non-stop jogging, I had to sit down on the floor because of absolute exhaustion. Given that I really wanted to get better at my sport, I used to push myself quite hard, thinking that I had to train way more and way harder.

One sunny day of 2024 summer holidays, with my family at [Miramar](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramar_(Buenos_Aires)), we went to the beach in the morning as usual. As any other day, we enjoyed the atmosphere, spent time relaxing, and I swam in the sea. In the afternoon, because it got cloudy, my mum suggested to go to the hospital for a checkup, given that I had gone badly to the bathroom the last days.

> This kid needs hospitalization and blood transfusion.

What? I had just swam in the sea that morning. But, indeed, in the following days we came back to our home city; I got hospitalized and, after a few days, I was (thankfully) diagnosed with celiac disease. Thankfully because, despite consuming everyday food like bread or pizza severely damages my intestine, after just two months of strict diet, I gained ~10 kg, could jog for ~30 minutes straight, and my skin got normal (and not just for _normal for me_ this time). After six months I was able to jog for 80 minutes straight, and within less than a year people even began complimenting my physique. But more importantly, I've noticeably felt much better since then, with a lot more energy and simply better overall.

Beyond the surface, this experience taught me that sometimes you don't realize how bad your current state is until you start to be at a decent, _actually normal_ level. It also made me very disciplined over time, both before and after discovering my disease; before because the habit of pushing myself hard to improve remained within me, even if it's not as necessary as it used to be; and after because now I _have to_ be strict with my diet, something that I tend to translate to discipline in exercise and sleep. Being strict, in addition, induces me to appreciate much more some things that are usually taken from granted.

### First commercial project (2024)

School year started, and a friend of mine told me that his father's company, [Siderplast S.A.](https://siderplast.com.ar), was looking to rebuild their ERP system and online store from scratch, given that they were getting very archaic. I talked with my friend's brother, who was in charge of the management, and he told me that if I made a good job, they'd pay me well. Just with my experience of building little apps and games, I accepted the challenge.

Previously, I had only touched backend in a project using FastAPI, but I decided to use **Django** (which I had just completed the docs tutorial a month ago) as it seemed a better fit for the requirements of [the project]({filename}/siderplast.md).

Three months passed in working without knowing whether I was going to get paid or not, until one day they call me and ask me how much I wanted to charge. Without much of an idea, I made a quote and got 10% more than I had asked for.

I kept working for around 6 months more, in which I mastered the tech stack, gained experience turning client requests into actual features, and learned how to handle large projects.

### Taking the leap (2025)

#### Silver.dev

Thanks to my dad's recommendation, since 2023 I'd listen to the [Tecnología Informal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrtLMjKidFAvi_CTWo5WQV3_X_E5FoaNg) podcast. I genuinely liked the way of thinking of the author, [Gabriel Benmergui](https://x.com/conanbatt); my favorite episode is, not casually, [El Programador de Hierro](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02poYpZXmfX2YRejgXYUWP) (The Iron Programmer, in English), where he compares the attitudes of two converse programmer archetypes. Two years later, Gabriel published the founding engineer [job position](https://x.com/Conanbatt/status/1886154690519249094) at his own company, [Silver.dev](https://silver.dev). _This is my opportunity_, I thought, despite I didn't meet the requirements (not even the working hours, since I was still attending school in the mornings). But I applied, anyway.

A few days later, in February 2025, while hanging out with some friends, I received an email calling me to the live coding interview. If that alone was surprising, the email even detailed the problems I'd have to solve. Ignoring my confusion, I just practiced until I could solve them in time. The interview day arrived and, indeed, I had to solve the problems I had practiced. Only one of the two, actually, so I solved the problem in half of the available time. To my great surprise, that was record time, so Gabriel was fascinated and hired me as an intern. I'd later discover that it was my answer to "Why are you interested in this position?" that attracted his attention in the first place, and that I had practiced way more usual for the interview.

So, I got in as a software engineer intern. In the mornings, I still attended secondary school; in the afternoons, I worked at Silver. During my time there, I learned **TypeScript** & **NextJS** and, moreover, how to work as part of a team, rather than just on my own. Besides, I realized what the other side of the interviews look like and how common it is not to practice for the interviews.

#### Hackathons

In March, I participated in my first hackathon ever, [ShipBA](https://shipba.dev), alongside the only programmer friend I knew by that time and my cousin. Without sleeping, we built [Noticiar]({filename}/noticiar.md), a TikTok-like AI-powered news app. Although we didn't win the competition, a bunch of people liked my presentation so much that they later invited me to more events, where I met even more people involved in the tech world.

In July, at my second hackathon, [Vibe a Startup](https://www.vibeastartup.com/), I placed third with my team by assembling and presenting Nuvem Voice (a.k.a. _el coso del cosito_ project), a customer service AI voice agent.

#### University Admission

Being my senior year at school, I had to decide what I wanted to do afterwards, just as any other teen. At first, given that I had already made money programming, I was doubting whether to go to college or not. I talked to most people I knew and thought about it a few months. To correctly solve my disjunctive, I was suggested to clarify to myself who I wanted to become in 5 or 10 years time. What I had clear was that I wanted to build cool stuff. To that end, both options were fine; however, one of them is clearly better done at that age than later. Still, I wasn't 100% sure to commit to that decision yet.

It was time to decide where to study, and my alternatives were: the public [UBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires), recommended by my professors and parents, where my brother had gone to; the also public [UTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Technological_University), where my parents had gone to; and perhaps, if I could earn a scholarship, the expensive [ITBA](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Buenos_Aires), recommended by Gabriel, where many people I met at ShipBA were studying.

However, among the people I've met this year, [Santiago](https://x.com/santiagomelian_) and [Gadi](https://x.com/gadiborovich) (both of whom I met thanks to ShipBA) separately suggested me to study in the US at Stanford or some Ivy, something that hadn't even crossed my mind until then. At first, it sounded a bit crazy (how could someone like me, just a student at a school in Caballito, possibly get admitted to such university?). But Gadi connected me with [Lichu](https://x.com/lichuacu), an Argentinian who had gotten into Stanford. He showed me that, while not easy, it wasn't an irrational idea. Aside from that, Stanford, particularly Silicon Valley, is the global center for high technology and innovation, so I pictured it like kind of the perfect place to continue my life on. Given all that, I decided to give it a chance. I was then fully committed to my decision.

### To be continued...

This document isn't finished, just as my life hasn't. I'll come back here in a few months and update it as I go along. See you!
